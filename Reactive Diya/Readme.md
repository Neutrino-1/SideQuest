# Reactive Diya
 
My take on digital version of Diya, which is reactive to light and also to wind just like real Diya!

Diya - is an oil lamp made from clay or mud with a cotton wick dipped in Oil or ghee. 
These lamps are commonly used in the Indian subcontinent and they hold sacred prominence in Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist and Jain prayers 
as well as religious rituals, ceremonies and festivals including Diwali.
